# Fix Windows 11 "Some Settings Are Managed By Your Organization"

This PowerShell script resolves the **"Some settings are managed by your organization"** message in Windows 11 by resetting local group policy and removing problematic registry keys. It also creates a system restore point before making changes and reboots the system automatically when finished.

## What It Does

* Creates a system restore point for safety.
* Resets local security policies.
* Removes local and machine-wide group policy settings from the registry.
* Forces a group policy update.
* Silently reboots the computer to apply changes.

## Usage

1. **Deploy** the script via NinjaOne (or another RMM) / run it as an Administrator on the affected machine.
2. **Note:** The script will automatically reboot the computer after execution.
